# Penetration Testing Project Repository

This repository documents a complete five-phase penetration testing workflow, implemented using an organized Git branching model. Each key phase of the assessment is isolated into its own branch to ensure clean versioning, repeatability, and professional documentation standards.

## Repository Structure

- **main** – Project overview, methodology, scope, documentation.
- **reconnaissance** – Host discovery, network mapping, and passive information gathering.
- **scanning** – Port scanning, service enumeration, network profiling.
- **vulnerability-assessment** – Vulnerability identification, analysis, and validation.
- **exploitation** – Controlled exploitation, privilege escalation, persistence checks.
- **reporting** – Final technical and executive reporting with evidence.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to simulate and document a full penetration testing lifecycle while maintaining strong operational structure, clarity, and professional reporting standards.

## Usage

Switch to each phase branch to follow the documented workflow and maintain separate commits for:
- Recon activities
- Scanning results
- Vulnerability triage
